A selection of my research projects across perception, cognitive science, and computational modeling:

---

### üß† [Audiovisual Duration Estimation under Uncertainty](/projects/av-duration/)

Doctoral research at NYU investigating how humans estimate time when faced with sensory conflict and noise.  
- Bayesian causal inference models  
- Psychophysical experiments with varying auditory noise  
- Supervisor: Michael S. Landy

### üß™ Continuous Psychophysics for Clinical Populations

Project at University of Southampton with CPC.  
- Optimized continuous psychophysics methods  
- Focused on applications for rapid assessment in clinical contexts  
- Co-supervised by Guido Maiello and Pascal Mamassian
